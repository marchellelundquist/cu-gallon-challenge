Website developed as part of our project for Spring 2016 Design for America studio.  This semester, we worked with the organizers of the Columbia University Gallon Challenge to make the challenge more impactful for the participants and to increase the amount of students who undertake the challenge.  We updated the branding and promotional materials for the challenge, designed new logos and infographics for the labels on the gallons, and created a website for the challenge.  This site contains information about the Gallon Challenge as well as tips and tricks on how to conserve water and explanations about why water conservancy is important, even in a city like New York.  This year there was a 66% increase in student participation in the challenge and we received positive feedback about our efforts to make the challenge a more educational experience.
